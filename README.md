# angleSensor
A program written for the Esduino Extreme Microcontroller that derives an angle reading from the output of an accelerometer

 ## About
The project includes code written in C for the Esduino Extreme Microcontroller, including code for analog-to-digital conversion of the output signal, a linear approximation algorithm to determine the specific angle of inclination, and finally code written in Matlab to graph the angle change over time. The final angle is output to a series of LEDs on the peripheral breadboard, displaying the angle either in Bar Decimal or Binary Coded Decimal format. 

### Parts of the Project:
 * Code in C for the Microcontroller, including ADC, Bus Clock setting, Serial Communication, and output to LEDs
 * Code in Matlab to output the angle overtime via the serial communication at specified baud rate
 * A report formatted to IEEE guidelines including a thorough description of the project
 * A user guide
